Contributing to PyVISA
======================

You can contribute in different ways:

Report issues
-------------

You can report any issues with the package, the documentation to the PyVISA
`issue tracker`_. Also feel free to submit feature requests, comments or
questions. In some cases, platform specific information is required. If you
think this is the case, run the following command and paste the output into
the issue::

    pyvisa-info

It is useful that you also provide the log output. To obtain it, add the
following lines to your code::

    import pyvisa
    pyvisa.log_to_screen()

If your issue concern a specific instrument please be sure to indicate the
manufacturer and the model.


Contribute code
---------------

To contribute fixes, code or documentation to PyVISA, send us a patch, or fork
PyVISA in github_ and submit the changes using a pull request.

You can also get the code from PyPI_ or GitHub_. You can either clone the
public repository::

    $ git clone git://github.com/pyvisa/pyvisa.git

Download the tarball::

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/pyvisa/pyvisa/tarball/master

Or, download the zipball::

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/pyvisa/pyvisa/zipball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your Python package,
or install it into your site-packages easily::

    $ python setup.py install


.. note:: If you have an old system installation of Python and you don't want to
   mess with it, you can try `Anaconda`_. It is a free Python distribution by
   Continuum Analytics that includes many scientific packages.


Contributing to an existing backend
-----------------------------------

Backends are the central piece of PyVISA as they provide the low level
communication over the different interfaces. There a couple of backends in the
wild which can use your help. Look them up in PyPI_ (try `pyvisa` in the search
box) and see where you can help.


Contributing a new backend
--------------------------

If you think there is a new way that low level communication can be achieved,
go for it. You can use any of the existing backends as a template or start a
thread in the `issue tracker`_ and we will be happy to help you.
