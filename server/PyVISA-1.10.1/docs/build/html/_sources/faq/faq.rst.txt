Miscellaneous questions
=======================


Is *PyVISA* endorsed by National Instruments?
---------------------------------------------

No. *PyVISA* is developed independently of National Instrument as a wrapper
for the VISA library.


Who makes *PyVISA*?
-------------------

PyVISA was originally programmed by Torsten Bronger and Gregor Thalhammer.
It is based on earlier experiences by Thalhammer.

It was maintained from March 2012 to August 2013 by Florian Bauer.
It was maintained from August 2013 to December 2017 by Hernan E. Grecco <hernan.grecco@gmail.com>.
It is currently maintained by Matthieu Dartiailh <m.dartiailh@gmail.com>

Is PyVISA thread-safe?
----------------------

Yes, PyVISA is thread safe starting from version 1.6.


I have an error in my program and I am having trouble to fix it
---------------------------------------------------------------

PyVISA provides useful logs of all operations. Add the following commands to
your program and run it again::

    import pyvisa
    pyvisa.log_to_screen()


I found a bug, how can I report it?
-----------------------------------

Please report it on the `Issue Tracker`_, including operating system, python
version and library version. In addition you might add supporting information
by pasting the output of this command::

    pyvisa-info


Error: Image not found
----------------------

This error occurs when you have provided an invalid path for the VISA library.
Check that the path provided to the constructor or in the configuration file


Error: Could not found VISA library
-----------------------------------

This error occurs when you have not provided a path for the VISA library and
PyVISA is not able to find it for you. You can solve it by providing the
library path to the ``VisaLibrary`` or ``ResourceManager`` constructor::

    >>> visalib = VisaLibrary('/path/to/library')

or::

    >>> rm = ResourceManager('Path to library')

or creating a configuration file as described in :ref:`intro-configuring`.


Error: `visa` module has no attribute `ResourceManager`
-------------------------------------------------------

The https://github.com/visa-sdk/visa-python provides a visa package that can
conflict with :py:mod:`visa` module provided by PyVISA, which is why the
:py:mod:`visa` module is deprecated and it is preferred to import
:py:mod:`pyvisa` instead of :py:mod:`visa`. Both modules provides the
same interface and no other changes should be needed.


Error: No matching architecture
-------------------------------

This error occurs when you the Python architecture does not match the VISA
architecture.

.. note:: PyVISA tries to parse the error from the underlying foreign function
   library to provide a more useful error message. If it does not succeed, it
   shows the original one.

   In Mac OS X the original error message looks like this::

    OSError: dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/visa.framework/visa, 6): no suitable image found.  Did find:
        /Library/Frameworks/visa.framework/visa: no matching architecture in universal wrapper
        /Library/Frameworks/visa.framework/visa: no matching architecture in universal wrapper

   In Linux the original error message looks like this::

    OSError: Could not open VISA library:
        Error while accessing /usr/local/vxipnp/linux/bin/libvisa.so.7:/usr/local/vxipnp/linux/bin/libvisa.so.7: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32


First, determine the details of your installation with the help of the
following debug command::

    pyvisa-info

You will see the 'bitness' of the Python interpreter and at the end you will
see the list of VISA libraries that PyVISA was able to find.

The solution is to:

  1. Install and use a VISA library matching your Python 'bitness'

     Download and install it from **National Instruments's VISA**. Run the
     debug command again to see if the new library was found by PyVISA. If not,
     create a configuration file as described in :ref:`intro-configuring`.

     If there is no VISA library with the correct bitness available, try
     solution 2.

or

  2. Install and use a Python matching your VISA library 'bitness'

     In Windows and Linux: Download and install Python with the matching
     bitness. Run your script again using the new Python

     In Mac OS X, Python is usually delivered as universal binary (32 and
     64 bits).

     You can run it in 32 bit by running::

        arch -i386 python myscript.py

     or in 64 bits by running::

        arch -x86_64 python myscript.py

     You can create an alias by adding the following line

        alias python32="arch -i386 python"

     into your .bashrc or .profile or ~/.bash_profile (or whatever file
     depending on which shell you are using.)

     You can also create a `virtual environment`_ for this.
