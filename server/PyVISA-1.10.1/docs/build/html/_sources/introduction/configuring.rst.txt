Configuring the backend
=======================

.. include:: ../substitutions.sub

Currently there are two backends available: The one included in pyvisa, which
uses the NI library, and the backend provided by pyvisa-py, which is a pure
python implementation of the VISA library. If no backend is specified, pyvisa
uses the NI backend if the NI library has been installed (see next section for
details). Failing that, it uses the pyvisa-py backend.

You can also select a desired backend by passing a parameter to the
ResourceManager, shown here for pyvisa-py:

    >>> visa.ResourceManager('@py')

Alternatively it can also be selected by setting the environment variable
PYVISA_LIBRARY. It takes the same values as the ResourceManager constructor.

Configuring the NI backend
--------------------------

.. note::

    The NI backend requires that you install first the NI-VISA library. You can
    get info here: (:ref:`faq-getting-nivisa`)


In most cases PyVISA will be able to find the location of the shared visa
library. If this does not work or you want to use another one, you need to
provide the library path to the |ResourceManager| constructor::

    >>> rm = ResourceManager('Path to library')


You can make this library the default for all PyVISA applications by using
a configuration file called :file:`.pyvisarc` (mind the leading dot) in your
`home directory`_.

==========================  ==================================================
Operating System            Location
==========================  ==================================================
Windows NT                  :file:`<root>\\WINNT\\Profiles\\<username>`
--------------------------  --------------------------------------------------
Windows 2000, XP and 2003   :file:`<root>\\Documents and Settings\\<username>`
--------------------------  --------------------------------------------------
Windows Vista, 7 or 8       :file:`<root>\\Users\\<username>`
--------------------------  --------------------------------------------------
Mac OS X                    :file:`/Users/<username>`
--------------------------  --------------------------------------------------
Linux                       :file:`/home/<username>` (depends on the distro)
==========================  ==================================================

For example in Windows XP, place it in your user folder "Documents and Settings"
folder, e.g. :file:`C:\\Documents and Settings\\smith\\.pyvisarc` if "smith" is
the name of your login account.

This file has the format of an INI file. For example, if the library
is at :file:`/usr/lib/libvisa.so.7`, the file :file:`.pyvisarc` must
contain the following::

   [Paths]

   VISA library: /usr/lib/libvisa.so.7

Please note that `[Paths]` is treated case-sensitively.

You can define a site-wide configuration file at
:file:`/usr/share/pyvisa/.pyvisarc` (It may also be
:file:`/usr/local/...` depending on the location of your Python).
Under Windows, this file is usually placed at
:file:`c:\\Python27\\share\\pyvisa\\.pyvisarc`.
