Installation
============

.. include:: ../substitutions.sub

PyVISA is a frontend to the VISA library. It runs on Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

You can install it using pip_::

    $ pip install -U pyvisa


Backend
-------

In order for PyVISA to work, you need to have a suitable backend. PyVISA
includes a backend that wraps the `National Instruments's VISA`_ library.
However, you need to download and install the library yourself
(See :ref:`faq-getting-nivisa`). There are multiple VISA implementations from
different vendors. PyVISA is tested only against
`National Instruments's VISA`_.

.. warning::

    PyVISA works with 32- and 64- bit Python and can deal with 32- and 64-bit
    VISA libraries without any extra configuration. What PyVISA cannot do is
    open a 32-bit VISA library while running in 64-bit Python (or the other
    way around).

**You need to make sure that the Python and VISA library have the same bitness**

Alternatively, you can install `PyVISA-Py`_ which is a pure Python
implementation of the VISA standard. You can install it using pip_::

    $ pip install -U pyvisa-py

.. note::

    At the moment, `PyVISA-Py` implements only a limited subset of the VISA
    standard and does not support all protocols on all bus systems. Please
    refer to its documentation for more details.


Testing your installation
-------------------------


That's all! You can check that PyVISA is correctly installed by starting up
python, and creating a ResourceManager:

    >>> import pyvisa
    >>> rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
    >>> print(rm.list_resources())

If you encounter any problem, take a look at the :ref:`faq-faq`. There you will
find the solutions to common problem as well as useful debugging techniques.
If everything fails, feel free to open an issue in our `issue tracker`_


Using the development version
-----------------------------

You can install the latest development version (at your own risk) directly
form GitHub_::

    $ pip install -U https://github.com/pyvisa/pyvisa/zipball/master


.. note::

    If you have an old system installation of Python and you don't want to
    mess with it, you can try `Anaconda`_. It is a free Python distribution
    by Continuum Analytics that includes many scientific packages.
